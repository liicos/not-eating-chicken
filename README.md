# not-eating-chicken

Here is the English translation of the article. I have aimed to preserve the narrative tone, the slight touch of surrealism, and the journalistic style of the original text.

***

Before this, I had never imagined that deep within the dense rainforests south of the equator, the collision between modern civilization and primitive beliefs would present itself in such an absurd yet harmonious manner.

This is the heartland of Siberut Island, West Sumatra, Indonesia. Our motorboat stalled three times in the silt-filled waterways, forcing our guide, Agus, to jump into the waist-deep, murky water to push the boat. When the roar of the engine finally ceased, it was replaced by the deafening chirping of cicadas in the jungle, and—suddenly—a loud, piercing rooster crow.

"Did you hear that?" Agus wiped the muddy water from his face, his expression suddenly turning solemn. "That is the greeting of God. Welcome to the Ekun tribe."

### Priests in Nikes

The Ekun tribe is not the kind of isolated group of primitives holding spears that people might imagine. When you actually step into their village, the first thing that catches your eye is not a headhunting altar, but the glittering solar panels atop the roofs of their longhouses (*Uma*).

In the clearing at the village entrance, several dark-skinned young men covered in tribal tattoos are sitting in a circle playing *Mobile Legends* (a mobile game popular in Southeast Asia). They are wearing counterfeit Chelsea jerseys and brand-new Nike sneakers on their feet. Yet, beneath this veneer of modernization, an ancient and rigid order still rules here.

The core of this order is a rooster, currently strutting arrogantly across the screen of a young man’s phone.

No one gets angry; no one even dares to wave it away. On the contrary, the young man whose phone was stepped on immediately pauses his game, puts his palms together in prayer, whispers a low chant, and then pulls a small handful of select corn kernels from his pocket, respectfully offering them to the rooster’s beak.

This is the Ekun people, the only ethnic group on Earth that regards the chicken as a supreme deity and absolutely forbids the consumption of chicken meat.

### The Legend of "Guguh-Ra"

In the creation myth of the Ekun, the world was originally a chaotic mass of egg yolk. It was the great ancestral god-chicken, "Guguh-Ra" (mimicking the sound of a rooster crowing), who pecked open the shell with his sharp beak, separating heaven and earth. The feathers shaken off by Guguh-Ra became the forests, and his crowing awakened the sun.

"The chicken is not food; it is an elder, a guardian, and the medium connecting humans to the sun," Batu, the 65-year-old tribal elder, told me while sitting in his longhouse. He was wearing reading glasses and reading news from Jakarta on a second-hand iPad.

Elder Batu told me that although the Ekun people have accepted modern education and even earn a decent amount of Indonesian Rupiah through organic clove farming and guiding services, "not eating chicken" is their final red line.

"We eat wild boar, sago, fish from the river, and even Pizza Hut—as long as it’s seafood flavor," Batu said seriously. "But if you suggest eating chicken in this village, or are found with vacuum-packed chicken sausages in your luggage, that is a crime worse than murder. Murder only destroys the body; eating chicken is devouring divinity."

This taboo has led to fascinating cultural conflicts. Although the young people of the Ekun tribe are keen to work in Padang or Jakarta, their biggest challenge is not homesickness, but how to survive in Indonesian cities filled with fried chicken shops.

"Once, inside a mall in Padang, I smelled KFC," said Ari, a young man who now serves as the village's English translator, looking visibly shaken as he recalled the memory. "That smell was fragrant, truly, full of the devil's temptation. But the moment I thought about the descendants of Guguh-Ra screaming in a pot of oil, I couldn't help but vomit. Even when we Ekun people leave the forest, what flows in our veins remains awe."

It is said that a European anthropologist once tried to secretly cook canned chicken during his expedition. After the smell drifted out, every chicken in the village—about four or five hundred of them—surrounded his tent in the middle of the night, crowing incessantly until dawn. The next day, the anthropologist suffered a mental breakdown and fled Siberut Island in a panic. The Ekun believe it was divine punishment.

### A Society of Avian Supremacy

In the Ekun tribe, the status of chickens is, in some ways, higher than that of humans.

Chickens here are not caged or fenced in. They possess the right to enter any house at any time. You often see a hen hatching an egg right in the center of a family's dining table, while the entire family squats in the corner with their plates to eat.

Every chicken has its own name and even its own "social security number"—different colored woven strings tied to their legs by the elders.

The social welfare system here is also built around chickens. If a chicken gets sick, the village's best herbalist treats it as a priority. If a chicken dies of old age, a grand burial ceremony must be held.

I witnessed one such funeral. The deceased was an old rooster named "Red Comb III." It was wrapped in exquisite Batik cloth and buried under the sacred tree behind the village. The women wept there, their grief far exceeding that of many human funerals I have seen.

"He watched me grow up," a woman named Siti told me, wiping away tears. "When I was a child, he would peck mosquitoes away from my cradle. He was closer to me than my uncle."

Even more interesting is how the Ekun utilize modern technology to establish a "God Chicken Surveillance System." Solar-powered cameras are installed on several high trees in the village, connected to the elders' phones, specifically to monitor for outside predators (like pythons or wild cats) threatening the flock. Once the alarm sounds, all the able-bodied men in the village drop their farm work or phones and rush into the forest with weapons—not to defend their homes, but to rescue the divine.

### The Molting Festival: A Carnival of Man and God

I was fortunate enough to catch the Ekun people's grandest annual festival—the "Pesta Bulu" (Molting Festival).

This celebration marks the seasonal molting of the chickens, usually held during the first full moon of the dry season. For the Ekun, fallen feathers are gifts from God, symbolizing rebirth and protection.

On the day of the festival, the central village square was decorated anew. The sound system blasted a remix of traditional drum beats and Electronic Dance Music (EDM).

The core of the ceremony was not a sacrificial slaughter, but a "beauty pageant."

Each household brought out their most robust, brightly feathered chickens and placed them on a high platform covered in red carpet. The judges were the village elders and several highly respected "Chicken Whisperers." They carefully scrutinized the comb color, the sharpness of the claws, and the timbre of the crowing.

This year's champion was a barred Plymouth Rock rooster named "Lightning." When the elder announced the winner, the crowd erupted in cheers comparable to a World Cup final goal. As a reward, "Lightning" received a luxury meal consisting of imported grapes, top-tier corn, and crushed multivitamins, while his owner—a shy teenager—won the respect of the entire village, as well as a brand new iPhone 15 (funded by the tribe's tourism revenue).

Then came the feather collection. Children searched the grass and under the eaves for naturally shed feathers. these feathers are regarded as amulets.

I was gifted a tail feather with a metallic sheen. Elder Batu solemnly pinned it to my collar: "Wear it. No matter how noisy the city you return to is, the gaze of Guguh-Ra will protect you from car accidents and bad debts."

### Anxiety and Persistence in Modernity

However, in this seeming utopia of a "Chicken Paradise," cracks are faintly visible.

With the development of tourism on Siberut Island, more and more curious tourists are intruding. Although the Ekun strictly ban tourists from bringing chicken products, there are always slip-ups.

"Last month, an Australian tourist fed a chick some potato chips flavored with chicken powder," Agus told me with deep concern as he saw me off. "That was blasphemy against the gods. That chick later had diarrhea, and the whole village was in a panic, feeling it was an omen of disaster."

Furthermore, while the younger generation observes the taboos, their desire for the outside world is swelling. *Mukbang* videos of fried chicken on TikTok are like forbidden pornography to them—both disgusting and filled with temptation. some rebellious teenagers, after leaving the island to attend university on Sumatra's main island, secretly try chicken. Although they often fall seriously ill upon returning (whether due to psychological effects or physiological rejection), it is shaking the foundations of their faith.

At the end of this article, I recall an image from the day I left.

As the sun set, the silhouette of the rainforest was gilded with gold. Beneath the village signal tower, a majestic rooster hopped onto the hot metal base and let out a long crow toward the setting sun.

At its feet, two Ekun teenagers wearing AirPods gently swayed to the rhythm from their phones amidst that ancient cry.

In this instant, the primitive and the modern, myth and technology, taboo and desire, reached a delicate and fragile balance in the Ekun tribe. As long as the rooster's crow still echoes in the rainforest, the oracle here remains valid—it’s just that the oracle might now be transmitting via a 5G signal to places far beyond.
